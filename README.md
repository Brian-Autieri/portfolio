# Brian Autieri's Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio so that users can view the most important information about me in one place. This webpage gives users a way learn about the projects I've built, my education and work experience and provides several ways to connect with me. It includes:

- My name
- A recent photograph
- An "About ME" section that gives a brief, yet detailed description of my background and hobbies
- A "Work" section that currently has placeholder images/links to showcase future projects
- A "Contact Me" section including my phone number, email, GitHub and LinkedIn
