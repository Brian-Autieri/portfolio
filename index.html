          Welcome to my coding portfolio! I'm a passionate web developer based in the vibrant Venice Beach, California. Currently, I'm pursuing my coding education through the prestigious Coding Boot Camp at UCLA Extension. Originally hailing from Florida, I ventured westward to join the dynamic sales team at Tesla. However, my journey didn't stop there.

During my time in Venice, I explored various avenues and discovered my passion for holistic well-being. I delved into the world of luxury spas, where I worked as a Certified Massage Therapist, providing rejuvenation and relaxation to clients. Additionally, I expanded my horizons by becoming a Registered Yoga Teacher, promoting physical and mental harmony. I even obtained my California Real Estate License, further broadening my skill set.

My academic background revolves around business studies, which equipped me with a strong foundation. Now, I'm thrilled to embark on an exciting new chapter in web development. As I immerse myself in this field, I'm eager to create innovative digital experiences and contribute to the ever-evolving online landscape.

When I'm not engrossed in school projects, you'll likely find me skateboarding along the lively boardwalk, reveling in the coastal beauty. I love embarking on thrilling adventures with my girlfriend, Jennifer, as we explore new horizons together. Fueling my body with wholesome nourishment is a priority, and Erewhon is a go-to spot for a nutritious meal. And of course, I indulge my playful side with the Nintendo Switch, engaging in virtual adventures and entertainment.

Join me as I showcase my coding journey and bring ideas to life through captivating web development projects. Together, let's shape the digital world one line of code at a time!
